I want to check-in with you. How is your search for a lender going?<br><br>

Like anything else, you get out of it what you put in. While we're experienced at this, this platform is new. If at any point, something does not work as expected, or if you need help, email support@lenderprism.com. That's where me and my co-founder will see your comments and requests. We'll be there for you should you have any questions on how to use the platform for best results.<br><br>

It's my mission to make sure that you have a successful experience, which to me means<br><br>

* Receiving as dozens of competitive quotes as possible and<br>
* Addressing your questions about the process and options available to you<br><br>

We're here to help you get the most out of our platform. Your feedback is crucial to us! Email support@lenderprism.com<br><br>
