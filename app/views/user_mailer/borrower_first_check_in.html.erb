You now have one place to find all commercial real estate financing products in the market. Bridge, equity, permanent debt and more. The LenderPrism delivers transparency and efficiency. It does it fast. Within minutes, you can have a list of lenders that are a possible match for your transaction.<br><br>

The LenderPrism consists of two products.<br><br>

The Prospector&trade; is a simple search tool. Use it to search more than 10,000 banks and credit unions in over 100,000 locations nationwide. Enter the zip code in which the property is located and search by distance. Select lenders to add to your list. Contact banks and credit unions on your own. It's a great tool for borrowers and mortgage brokers who need a smaller loan or prefer a traditional banking experience. It's very useful! I've used it to identify and connect with lenders in a small market.<br><br>

The Lender Funnel&trade; is a more robust tool. Search hundreds of non-bank lenders we've verified as being active. They are lending on multifamily and commercial real estate. We have their lending criteria. We have contact info for real people. We update this information regularly. Enter basic search criteria. Identify possible matches. We'll connect you with real people.<br><br>

While we're experienced at this, this platform is new. We're still in Beta. So please be patient as we work to improve the experience. Your input is part of that process. Your feedback is very valuable to us. Please submit comments, bugs and ideas for improvement. Use the widget in the corner.<br><br>

Thank you for exploring the LenderPrism.<br><br>
